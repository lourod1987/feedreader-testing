# Feed Reader
This project consists of tests built using the Jasmine framework to test against an RSS feed app.

## Run the application
1)
    * To get the files you can fork and clone or directly clone the repository from this page. 
    * If you are downloading the files, unzip them, and extract the files to where you want them in your directory.
2)
    * Once the files are locally stored open the index.html from the directory where the rest of the files are located in your favorite browser to start the application.
    * Alternatively you can serve the files using a local file sever. Like http-server.
        * For installation and running directions visit [npm http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server).

## Using the application
Test results will appear at the bottom of the page. 

RSS feeds can be changed by click the menu icon at the top left of the page.

Clicking on any entry of a feed will take you to that article.

## Additional test
1) A test to ensure that page is loaded back to it's default state after all other testing is complete.
